# platform-vuejs

Created by the Cloud App Generator

Now that the application has been generated it can be deployed in the currently active project on OpenShift by running:

```
$ ./gap deploy
```

Now the only thing that is left to do is push the project's code to OpenShift to be run. To push the sources and
have the project be built on OpenShift you can do the following:

```
$ ./gap push
```

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
